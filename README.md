# Data-Imputation-and-RMSE-Analysis
The Data Imputation and RMSE Analysis project uses Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn to impute missing data in large, complex datasets. It leverages mean imputation and support vector regression to achieve high levels of accuracy, and visualizes the results using MS Excel.


This project is made totally on python programming language and I have used python version
3.7 for its implementation.

To make the code work, one have to install the python libraries sklearn and pandas.

The file named "main_code.ipynb" is the main code file for this project.
